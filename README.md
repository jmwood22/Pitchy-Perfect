# Pitchy-Perfect
Semester project for graduate level 3D Audio course.

The general idea of this project was to give a musican the opportunity to get real time feedback on their pitch
by playing a tone back to them with spatial cues and using headphones. If the musican was singing flat, they 
would hear the tone more in their right ear while if they were sharp, they would hear it more in their right.
As their pitch moved between sharp and flat, the tone would sound like it was moving around their head in
a similar manner that a tuning needle would. 

A more extensive description of the project can be found in the [Pitchy Perfect Final Report](Pitchy Perfect Final Report.pdf) and instructions
for running the software can be found in Instructions.txt
